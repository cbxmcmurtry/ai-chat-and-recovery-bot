# **AI Projects**

This repository contains these AI projects:
* **Disaster Recovery Robot Simulation** made in CoppeliaSim
*  **AI Career Chatbot** designed using Pandorabots and AIML.

## **Disaster Relief Recovery Robot Simulation**
### **Project Overview**
In this project, I designed a **disaster recovery robot** in **CoppeliaSim** to navigate an environment affected by an electrical fire. The robot detects and avoids obstacles such as a fallen bookshelf and exposed electrical cables using **LIDAR and infrared sensors**.  

The robot performs **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** to gather real-time data, providing first responders with room layouts and potential hazards.  

#### **Write-Up and Recording**
- Documented the implementation in a concise write-up.  
- Recorded a video showing the robot in action , and explained how it performs.

### **Key Features**
- **Obstacle Detection & Avoidance**: Uses LIDAR and infrared sensors.  
- **SLAM Navigation**: Maps the environment for real-time updates.  
- **Hazard Identification**: Detects fire hazards to assist first responders.  
- **Future Improvements**: Plans for reinforcement learning and advanced search algorithms.

## **AI Career Choice Project**
This project involved coding a chat bot to assist college students with selecting and researching potential career paths involving IT. 

### **Chatbot Development**
* Registered on **Pandorabots.com** 
* Designed chatbot interactions to guide college students on potential career paths using **AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language)**.  

### **Machine Learning Proposal**
This task focused on **proposing a machine learning solution** for a business problem.

#### **Write-Up Guidelines**
- **Timeline & Milestones**: Created a structured table with steps, start dates, and end dates.  
- **Resources & Costs**: Designed a budget table listing resource descriptions and estimated costs.  
- **Sources**: Properly cited all references using mixed citation formats.
